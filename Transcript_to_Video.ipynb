        "This implementation doesn't actually take MP3s like the title says.  The current approach is to provide a URL to a YouTube video with a transcript (i.e. closed captions).  \n",
        "\n",
        "This code should work using \"Run All\" (after you set a suitable YouTube URL below), there will be auth prompt for access to your Google Drive (for temporary files and the final video) and getpass prompting for your OpenAI and Stability API keys.  See notes in line for getting keys if you need pointers, they both include some free credits for new accounts.\n",
        "\n",
        "## TODO\n",
        " * Add animation (e.g. pan & zoom) effects.\n",
        " * Add transitions effects.  One approach is using Stability init_image to generate frame-by-frame animations that morph from one scene to the next.\n",
        " * Add review mode for image generation for easy way to accept/reject candidates.  Image generation is pretty hit or miss (with plenty of misses).  Right now if you want to replace an image you can remove the file from the folder in your drive and rerun the image generation step (because it doesn't regenerate images that already have a file with the matching description/name).\n",
        " * Support actually using MP3s and running STT on them to get the timed lyrics.  Although OpenAI Whisper API has timestamps the code we had didn't deliver them.  Google Speech and other APIs would work fine too.\n",
        " * Prompt refinements/experiments.\n",
        " * Buff up the error handling for:\n",
        "  * ChatGPT responses with bad CSV formatting.  LangChain is used here and I wanted to use tools and OpenAI Functions but that wound up not fitting in the time for the hackathon.\n",
        "  * Image descriptions that fail Stability filters.  Even seemingly innocuous words/phrases will fail and the current logic is to just skip those.  Retrying by asking ChatGPT to rephrase those descriptions is one possible solution."
